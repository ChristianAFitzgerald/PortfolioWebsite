    <h2>Websites and other code related work:</h2>
    <p>So far I've worked on the Zengarden CSS challenge and a larger collaborative website with about 20 other Web Application students. I also have some examples of my Javascript skills here.</p>

    <p>This is the Teens and Technology website, which was worked on with about 20 other students in my Web Applications Development class. I mainly focused my work on the teen driving section in a group of 4. We learned to use Git in group projects effectively on this assignment.</p>

    <p>I've also taken the Zengarden CSS challenge to increase my knowledge of CSS and apply what I know</p>
    <!--I need to find some images and links for my past programming experiences-->
    <p>This is one of my earliest websites, it was made to spread awareness about an endangered animal and was built with the assisstance of one other student. </p>

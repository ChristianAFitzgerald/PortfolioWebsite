    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <p>My name is Christian A. Fitzgerald and I come from Fresno, California. I build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve worked on multiple websites using my skills in these programming languages. Some projects I’ve worked on while learning these languages include a website about pangolins (an endangered animal) which was worked on with another student in my CART Web Application Development class and a website about teens and technology, which was divided into section that were worked on in groups of 4-6. This portfolio website is also another project of mine and I plan to improve it as my skills impro. In my spare time, I play video games such as Diablo 3, Warframe, and Darkest Dungeon.  My current goal in life is to work on making games, as gaming is my passion. You should also look at the work I’ve done by checking above in the portfolio section. If you like what you see and want to contact me, see the above “Contact Me” page for my LinkedIn, phone number, and email.</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <p>My name is Christian A. Fitzgerald and I come from Fresno, California. I build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve worked on multiple websites using my skills in these programming languages. Some projects I’ve worked on while learning these languages include a website about pangolins (an endangered animal) which was worked on with another student in my CART Web Application Development class and a website about teens and technology, which was divided into section that were worked on in groups of 4-6. This portfolio website is also another project of mine and I plan to improve it as I learn more. Right now, I plan to be certified in HTML and JavaScript by the end of the year. When I'm not building websites, I play video games such as Diablo 3, Warframe, and Darkest Dungeon. My current goal in life is to work on making games, as gaming is my passion and hobby. You can take a look at the work I’ve done or take a look at my resume by using the navigation above. If you like what you see and want to contact me, see the above “Contact Me” page for my LinkedIn, phone number, and email.</p>

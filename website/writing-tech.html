            <h2>Writing/English Work:</h2>
            <p>Here are a few examples of professional writing and essays I've done along with some photoshop work. This includes: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A photoshop project where I made multiple modifications to an image in Photoshop to learn the tools:</li>
                <!--Going to need to flex some images off into the side because I need to use less slideshows-->
                <li>An essay about Ready Player One and whether or not it should be read in high school english classes:</li>
            </ul>
        </div>        
           <div>
            <ul class="listIt">

            <h4 class="center">Ready Player One Argumentative Essay</h4>
            <p>
                Ready Player One by Earnest Cline should be a standard book in high school English classes today. The novel is more relatable to today’s teens, is a good example of escapism, and takes place in a future that is very closely related to today’s issues. I am firm in my belief that this book should be read in high school English classes because it’s relatable and relevant to teens while still providing teaching material.
